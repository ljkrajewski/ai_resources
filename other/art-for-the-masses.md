[Paragraph on case about Google vs. Perfect 10 (image thumbnails)]
```
The two most famous of these cases involve Google,
and the first case is called Perfect 10 vs Google
that involved Google, the search engine,
scraping basically the entire internet, including images,
and then producing thumbnails in search results,
smaller versions of the original images.
Now, Perfect 10 was a website that, how do I put this?
Made money by selling access to photos,
and I'll let you use your imagination as to
what kinds of photos people would pay lots of money for.
They didn't like that Google was
scraping their particular website
and displaying thumbnails of the images
that were contained on the Perfect 10 website.
They claimed that this was copyright infringement
and they sued Google over it.
The courts went back and forth.
But eventually the courts found that Google,
while it was effectively conducting copyright infringement,
because the thumbnails were used
for a different purpose than the original images,
Google was allowed to do that.
Effectively the search function and display of those
smaller thumbnails was not the same purpose
that people were using the original images for.

[Paragraph on case about Google vs. Authors Guild (Google books)]
```
The second similar case is called the Google Books Case,
which is the Authors Guild vs Google.
And again, Google was compiling a huge data set
of basically every book ever written
and then allowed people to search through that database.
The Authors Guild was not thrilled
with the ability of Google to search through
all of these different books.
Google argued that it had a fair use purpose
in being able to facilitate people
looking through all of these books,
and again, they weren't displaying the entire book itself,
but instead just small snippets of
where the particular phrase or word showed up
within a particular book itself.
And again, the court sided with Google,
and while the initial formation of this data set
and reproduction of these books
might qualify as copyright infringement,
the court said that Google was allowed to get away with
this search and display
because its purpose was for fair use purposes.
```

In both of these cases, the tecnological advances were ruled "Fair Use" because of the transormative affect they had on how we access and consume information.

What could be more transformative than the democratization of creativity?

Over the decades, the technology behind art has continued to advance, from changes in the composition of matierials to advances in techniques to the use of computers and digital automation. We have moved from charcoal, paint, and stone to Photoshop, Blender, and 3D printing. AI is the next natrual advancement in how we express ourselves.

Now, I'm not a lawyer, so

3 groups of people affected by AI art and advice for them

1. Actual artists. Every tecnological advance has displaced people. 19th centrury textile workers were displaced by factories. Buggie manufacturers are displaced by the automobile. Radio was displaced by broadcast television which was displaced by cable which was displaced by streaming. 

2. Companies who sell art. 

3. The "artistes d'Ã©lite". These are the self-appointed elites of the artistic community upset that us unwashed masses are touching their precious things.
