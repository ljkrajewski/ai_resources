# Text-to-Sound Generation & Voice Cloning
- [neonbjb/tortoise-tts](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts)  
Tortoise is a text-to-speech program built with the following priorities: strong multi-voice capabilities, and highly realistic prosody and intonation. This repo contains all the code needed to run Tortoise TTS in inference mode.

A _much_ older fork of **neonbjb/tortoise-tts**. Includes link to a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wVVqUPqwiDBUVeWWOUNglpGhU3hg_cbR?usp=sharing). Also has a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci8NaeFCUz4).

_GPU does not appear to be required._ üê∏TTS is a library for advanced Text-to-Speech generation. It's built on the latest research, was designed to achieve the best trade-off among ease-of-training, speed and quality. üê∏TTS comes with pretrained models, tools for measuring dataset quality and already used in 20+ languages for products and research projects.

A deep learning framework in three stages. In the first stage, one creates a digital representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. In the second and third stages, this representation is used as reference to generate speech given arbitrary text. **This repo is quickly getting old.** Many other open-source repositories or SaaS apps (often paying) will give you a better audio quality than this repository. [Here are some personal recommendations of alternative voice cloning solutions.](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning#heads-up)
