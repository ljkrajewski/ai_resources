# Text-to-Sound Generation
- [coqui-ai/TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/tts) _GPU not required._  
üê∏TTS is a library for advanced Text-to-Speech generation. It's built on the latest research, was designed to achieve the best trade-off among ease-of-training, speed and quality. üê∏TTS comes with pretrained models, tools for measuring dataset quality and already used in 20+ languages for products and research projects.

A deep learning framework in three stages. In the first stage, one creates a digital representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. In the second and third stages, this representation is used as reference to generate speech given arbitrary text. **This repo is quickly getting old.** Many other open-source repositories or SaaS apps (often paying) will give you a better audio quality than this repository. [Here are some personal recommendations of alternative voice cloning solutions.](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning#heads-up)
